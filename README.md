## About

This project provides a list of tools that can be used to simplify normal file actions (Example: File transfer, file upload, etc..) and makes these actions super easy and customizable.

The goal of this project is to make file transfers easier for users and to provide a solid foundation for anyone who needs to automate file movements in a scriptable way.

## Tools Available

  This tools allows you to copy your PC files directly into the tool folder, you could put this in a USB stick and doing so you can easily transfer files from your PC to another machine.
